Absolutely — here’s a clear explanation of how negative keyword lists are used to enforce the High-Medium-Low funnel strategy in Google Shopping, especially in Standard Shopping campaigns (since Performance Max doesn’t allow full negative keyword control).

How It Works: Controlling Search Terms with Campaign Structure + Negatives

To make sure each campaign only shows for the right type of search terms (generic, brand, or product-specific), you set up multiple Shopping campaigns with different priority levels and strategically placed negative keywords.

⸻

Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. High Funnel Campaign (Generic Terms Only)
	•	Campaign Priority: High
	•	Bids: Low
	•	Goal: Capture broad, low-intent traffic like “best infrared sauna”, “home sauna for 2 people”
	•	Negative Keywords:
	•	Block brand names (e.g., “golden designs”, “dynamic”)
	•	Block specific products (e.g., “dynamic barcelona sauna”)
	•	Why: To prevent this campaign from showing for higher-intent searches and reserve those for other campaigns.

⸻

2. Medium Funnel Campaign (Brand Searches Only)
	•	Campaign Priority: Medium
	•	Bids: Medium
	•	Goal: Capture branded searches like “golden designs sauna”, “dynamic sauna reviews”
	•	Negative Keywords:
	•	Block exact product names (e.g., “dynamic barcelona sauna”, “barcelona elite sauna”)
	•	Why: To prevent this campaign from picking up high-intent buyers who know the exact product. Those go to the Low funnel.

⸻

3. Low Funnel Campaign (Exact Product Terms Only)
	•	Campaign Priority: Low
	•	Bids: Highest
	•	Goal: Capture high-converting, product-specific searches like “buy dynamic barcelona sauna”
	•	Negative Keywords: None
	•	Why: This campaign should catch all the highly-qualified, product-name queries once they’re filtered out of the other two.

How Search Terms Are “Forced” Into the Right Campaign

Google chooses which Shopping campaign to use based on:
	1.	Campaign Priority (High > Medium > Low)
	2.	Eligibility (whether products match and are not blocked by negatives)

So, by:
	•	Using high priority with negatives in the top campaign,
	•	Medium priority with more refined negatives in the middle,
	•	And no negatives in the bottom campaign,

You funnel the user’s search query into the correct campaign based on their intent.

⸻

Quick Example:

A user searches “dynamic barcelona sauna”:
	•	The High campaign blocks “dynamic” and “barcelona” → not eligible
	•	The Medium campaign blocks “dynamic barcelona sauna” → not eligible
	•	The Low campaign has no negatives → ad is served here

⸻

This strategy gives you:
	•	More control over budget allocation
	•	Better ROAS at the bottom
	•	Cheap traffic for brand exposure at the top
